## Description

This will be an RPG adventure set in a Freak Show, where you (the protagonist) are trying to find job, until one day a mysterious circus comes to your city, without thinking twice you enter there to try luck. 

Once inside, you offer your service to the Showman, and he accepts.
However, nothing is as pretty as it seems, and swiftly you realize darkness is consuming everyone within and soon it will be your turn, unless you make your way to you escape.

Befriend your companions from the show and save yourselves from a terrible fate.
